The past few weeks of my internship at CSIT have been an exhilarating whirlwind of learning, growth, and discovery. As I immersed myself deeper into the fascinating world of generative AI and web development, I found my mind expanding in ways I never imagined possible.
Week 3: Diving into Prompt Engineering
Week 3 kicked off with an exciting exploration into the realm of prompt engineering on Jupyter Notebook.
One particularly memorable exercise involved showing Yai Hui a conversation between two Gemini 1.0 pro models that I had linked up. The exchange was as fascinating as it was hilarious - the models engaged in a lengthy discussion about the optimal method for cooking an egg, each one refining the other's response until they had generated thousands of words on the subject.
I also had the opportunity to create my very first set of prompt engineering templates during this week. By defining key values that the model needed to adhere to, such as neutrality, objectivity, and the ability to admit a lack of relevant documentation, I was able to transform a general-purpose LLM into a specialized assistant tailored for the needs of a tech-focused government agency with strict confidentiality requirements.
Week 4: Building the Web App
Week 4 brought a thrilling shift as I dove headfirst into the creation of my web application. Armed with absolutely no knowledge of Next.js, TypeScript and whatever that I needed, I set out to build an intuitive, responsive frontend that could seamlessly integrate with the powerful backend LLM.
A particularly vivid memory from this week was when Yai Hui visited me in my office. I had the opportunity to showcase the general layout feature that I had successfully implemented, and I was thrilled to see how impressed she was, especially considering my status as a noob to modern web development. Our subsequent discussion about the app's layout and functionality was both productive and enjoyable, as we delved deeper into the project scope and watched our mental models of the design evolve into something tangible.
Overcoming Challenges
As I wrestled with components, hooks, and APIs, I couldn't help but feel a rush of exhilaration every time a piece of the puzzle fell into place. I remember the night I finally got the real-time chat streaming feature working - seeing the AI's responses flow in smoothly, perfectly synced with the user's input, felt like magic.
Of course, there were also moments of frustration - countless hours spent staring at inscrutable error messages or chasing down elusive bugs. One particularly vexing issue involved an OpenAI API request that simply refused to work. Eventually, I noticed a tiny typo in my OpenAI configuration - `"stream=false"` instead of `"stream=true"` - and everything came crashing down. This experience served as a humbling reminder of the critical importance of attention to detail in this field.
Brown Bag Session and Insights
My final day of Week 4 included a brown bag session, during which I enjoyed an absolutely delicious meat lover's carbonara while listening to presentations from senior interns about their projects.
After the session, I had the chance to bond with my fellow interns for a while before engaging in a stimulating conversation with Yai Hui about my project, our internship experience, and the intricacies of microservices. I learned that Yai Hui had previously worked on backend microservices architecture before shifting to a new team focused on GenAI. She was worried that she might not have much to teach me about GenAI, however, she also introduced me to the wider world of software engineering, making me realize just how vast and full of potential this field truly is.
Looking Ahead
As I reflect on these past few weeks, I find myself overwhelmed with gratitude and excitement. I am deeply grateful for the incredible opportunity to work at CSIT, to learn from brilliant minds like Yai Hui who never hesitate to share their knowledge and provide guidance, and to contribute my own small part to this grand endeavor. Of course, like many other interns, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment at not receiving my own free CSIT apparel.
But far more powerful than any momentary disappointment is the excitement I feel for all that lies ahead. I think of the ambitious plans that Yai Hui and I have sketched out for the app, from the new Manual Document Search feature to the improved Home page and expanded chat functionalities. I can almost picture the looks of wonder (and hopefully approval) on the faces of the directors when I present this app to them, and I can't help but imagine the impact my code could have on streamlining information access within the organization.
I know that my journey is only just beginning, but I feel immensely privileged to be taking these first few steps. With curiosity as my compass, diligence as my engine, and the support of amazing mentors and colleagues as my wind, I am ready to see where this path leads me.
