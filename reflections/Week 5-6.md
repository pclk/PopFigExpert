31 March - 13 April

In the first week, I participated in the Cyberthon playtesting. It was such a fun time, especially since I didn't work alone as I was supposed to. I teamed up with my internmates (Alycia, Ryan, and Wei Xian) and we solved some very hard challenges together. I remember this cryptographic challenge where we were supposed to decrypt a encrypted file, given the encryption script. From there, we discovered that they used a private key that was randomly generated on runtime, which was 16 bits in length, meaning it was impossible to brute force. We spent many hours, and when we finally decrypted it at 6.45pm in the office, we were so pumped, that we spent about 5 mins celebrating, telling everyone about it. By that time, only us and my friend Gawain was there.

The best part about this victory was that each of us had made a unique contribution to the puzzle. All of us were able to bring us closer to the solution in a way that couldn't be done without each other. This experience was very rewarding and I'm grateful to have been a part of it.

Well after that, we went back to doing our work. I talked to Yai Hui, asking her whether to scrape full documents anew or to utilize the already chunked segments of these documents for the search functionality. I also considered including URLs in the search results, providing users the option to view full documents if needed.

We then scheduled a brief in person meeting to discuss further, which was quite delightful. She kept forgetting that she cannot use my special keyboard, that I feel kind of bad for. But i really cannot go back to typing in QWERTY, or using a normal keyboard anymore, even though at this point, having this special keyboard might be more harmful for productivity, since my dependence on it is quite high.

I remember a time when I forgot to bring my special keyboard to the office. I had to use the laptop's keyboard for awhile, and it was so difficult. I had to use one of those ergonomic keyboards from microsoft, which was just laying around somewhere in the open table. It was better. But especially coupled with time constraints, it was tough to get used to.

I return home to continue my work with my special keyboard and instantly reminded myself of the joy of using my special keyboard. I continue to discuss with my mentor on whether to use URLs as unique identifiers for my documents, which turns out, isn't a good practice, but it sure was a good idea :D. Yai Hui scolded me for my laziness, and had no choice but to agree.

I also started to consider my future career more seriously. I was tempted to skip university, because I believed that education hasn't served me well. I believed that everything that I was taught had been either useless or probably harmful. How I should think about other people, how I should think about myself etc. I also believed that everything to gain from university doesn't have to come at the cost of 4 precious years of my prime time. Networking with people is definitely extremely important, and I could just pay money to enter these networking events I would otherwise spend on university. Education about latest technologies can just be done through bootcamps and self-initiated projects, and I'd probably learn more in the process, much like how I've learnt so much in this internship period. 

I simply believed that the way education was set up, isn't conducive to my learning. But in the end, I need to understand that Singapore has a very strong certificate based education system. I don't see myself being able to survive without a degree, especially down the entrepreneurial path. In the tech industry, I have to come across as trustworthy, competent and reliable. A 22 year old NS serviceman who has just ORDed with no uni degree, coming out to networking events to pitch an AI service, screams incompetency and desperation. One must think that someone pursed this path because they can't make it to uni, are wishful delusional dreamers, and/or have made bad decisions along the way. At least I could be a 26-28 year old guy with a degree and connections, I'd have a higher chance of success in this world.

Morever, university has much more information packed into it than I thought. I realized, I didn't mind learning about software development. In fact, its probably why I'm in this space. Software engineering, in combination with the novel Gen AI tech, is probably one of the most interesting things to me. Having strong fundamentals in all languages, from C++ to Java to some esoteric language, is a pretty good way to get a deep and powerful sense of the programming world. Imagine a developer with 10 year experience in Python vs a developer with 10 years spread across Python, Java, React, C++, Rust, Go, Kotlin, Swift, Elxir, etc. Who would be able to have a deeper understanding of the programming world, invent something new, and change the world?

At this point, I'm fitting to the degrees, instead of making it fit me. But this is the life of Singapore, and pretty much the world. Despite this, I'm sure I would have an enriching experience as a university student. I can't wait to see what the future holds.


# Context
Text with mentor Yai Hui

During the early days of April 2024, I engaged in a detailed conversation with my mentor, Yai Hui, regarding the technical aspects of a project I was working on. The discussion primarily revolved around the optimal approach for handling document searches within a database that I was tasked to manage and improve.

Initially, I reached out to Yai Hui with a query about whether to scrape full documents anew or to utilize the already chunked segments of these documents for the search functionality. This was a critical decision as it impacted not only the efficiency of the search process but also the user experience. I proposed the idea of a chunk-based search, which could potentially enhance the user interface by allowing quicker access to relevant document sections. I also considered including URLs in the search results, providing users the option to view full documents if needed.

Yai Hui responded later, suggesting a brief meeting to discuss this further. This interaction highlighted the supportive and collaborative environment, where ideas were freely exchanged and explored.

Later that evening, I introduced another aspect of the project related to document identification. Upon scraping the documents, I noticed that URLs contained unique identifiers which could be used as document IDs. This observation was crucial as it simplified the tracking and retrieval of documents. Yai Hui agreed with this approach, acknowledging the practicality of using these URL segments as unique identifiers.

The conversation then shifted towards the efficiency of the system. I suggested using the entire URL as a document ID to streamline the process further. However, Yai Hui playfully chided this suggestion as a shortcut, emphasizing the importance of adhering to best practices like using proper unique identifiers or UUIDs. This exchange not only lightened the mood but also reinforced the importance of maintaining high standards in technical implementations.

Yai Hui then inquired about the operational aspects of the web crawler, specifically whether it was necessary to re-crawl entire websites or just the updated sections. I clarified that only changes or new additions were crawled, which was a more efficient approach. Yai Hui concurred, suggesting that while using URLs as identifiers was acceptable for now, it was essential to remember that best practices recommend using more formal unique identifiers.

Our discussion concluded with some logistical coordination regarding remote work arrangements and upcoming team activities, which included a bonding session at a CSIT orientation.
